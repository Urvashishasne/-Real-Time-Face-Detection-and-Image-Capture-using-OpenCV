- Manual image capture (press `y` to save)
- Saves cropped and resized face images
- Organized output in a local folder
- Simple and beginner-friendly code structure

## 📌 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- (Optional) NumPy, OS module (comes with Python)

## 📸 How It Works

2. Enter your name
3. Your webcam opens and detects your face
